# 🎯 Virtual Media Controller using Hand Gestures (Computer Vision + Python)

This project is a Computer Vision-based virtual media controller that uses hand gestures to perform common media functions like **Play, Pause, Volume Up/Down, Forward, and Rewind**. Built using Python and OpenCV, this tool leverages real-time video feed to recognize predefined hand gestures and converts them into virtual keyboard signals.

## 🚀 Features

- 👋 Real-time hand gesture detection
- 🎵 Controls media playback:
  - ▶️ Play / Pause
  - 🔊 Volume Up / Down
  - ⏩ Forward
  - ⏪ Rewind
- 📷 Uses your system camera for gesture detection
- 💻 Lightweight and easy to run

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python math
pip install opencv-python
pip install pyautogui
